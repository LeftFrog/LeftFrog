## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi! My name is Alex, and I'm a high school student passionate about games, music, and electronics.

I'm currently learning Python, C#, web development, and game development.

I'm not a rasict or a sexist. I hate everybody just the same.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a cross-platform game launcher called Bluise, primarily for Mac.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m expanding my knowledge in Python, C#, web development, and game development.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting projects.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you don't wanna, believe me. But if you have to here is my instagram: Left.Frog
